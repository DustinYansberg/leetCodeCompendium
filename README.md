# Leet Code Compendium

This project is a collection of my solutions for Leet Code problems. 
Each solution can be found in a folder whose name matches the problem number on Leet 
Code. For instance, Leet Code problem number 1 will have a folder named "1_two_sum"
and a file within called 'two_sum.py.' If I find it necessary, a folder will also contain a readme file
whose name is in line with the .py file. To continue with the example above, '1_two_sum' would
contain a README file called 'two_sum_README.md.'

### Q: Why structure it this way?
A: As I was adding another new leet code solution to my GitHub, I realized that my repositories
were becoming clustered with numerous leet code problems. I believe that putting all of my 
leet code solutions into on repository will help keep organizing my GitHub neat.
