# Leet Code Compendium

This project is a collection of my solutions for Leet Code problems. 
Each solution can be found in a folder whose name matches the problem number on Leet 
Code. For instance, Leet Code problem number 1 will have a folder named "leet_code_1"
and a file within called 'leet_code_1.py.' When necessary, a solution folder will also 
contain an .md file that provides additional context to the solution.

### Q: Why structure it this way?
A: As I was adding another new leet code solution to my GitHub, I realized that my repositories
were becoming clustered with numerous leet code problems. I believe that putting all of my 
leet code solutions into on repository will help keep organizing my GitHub neat.
